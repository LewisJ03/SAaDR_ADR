# Architecture for developement

## Context and Problem Statement

What architecture will you be using and why will they be beneficial?

I will be using a monolithic architecture to develope the codebase

## Decision Drivers

* Ease of use
* Scale
* speed of developement

## Considered Options

* monolithic
* layered

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "monolithic", because it allows for a fast and simple developement, allowing more work to be done during the sprint

### Consequences

* Good, because it allows for quick development
* Bad, because other architectures are much more manageable
* Good, because it allows for simpliar developement cycle
* Bad, as it is less scalable.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### monolithic:

### Pros:

* Simplicity 
* Rapid developement

### Cons:

* Scalability Limitations
* Harder to maintain


### layered:

### Pros:

* Easier to maintain, especically if still developing the program

* Scalability
### Cons:

* More complex than monolithic due to seperation

* Longer developement times
