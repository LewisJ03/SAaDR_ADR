# Front end development

## Context and Problem Statement

How will you create the frontend

I will be using python with the webframe flask, by using html templates and css static designs.
## Decision Drivers

* Simplicity due to inbuilt features of webframe, allowing for faster developement
* previous knowledge, allowing for more complex developement

## Considered Options

* Flask
* React

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Flask", because there is a large amount of documentation about the webframe, as well as the simplicity compared to other webframes which will allow for quicker development times.

### Consequences

* Good, because it allows for quick, straightforward learning and development.
* Bad, because other webframes such as react would require learning another complex language
* Good, because it has easier readability, allowing other developers to understand it easier.
* Bad, as it is less effective compared to other webframes in terms of scalability.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Flask:

### Pros:

* Simplicity and Documentation: Flask is known for its straightforward and minimalistic design, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to quickly learn and implement a back end. Its simplicity allows for a faster setup, which is beneficial for smaller projects or those with shorter timelines.

* Readability: Due to its minimalistic nature, Flask code is generally easier to read, which facilitates onboarding for new developers and supports a collaborative development environment.

### Cons:

* Scalability Limitations: Flask is not inherently designed with scalability in mind, which may make it less suitable for larger applications or those expecting significant growth in traffic.

* Less Built-in Database Support: While Flask can work with databases which comes with more built-in support for ORM and SQL database handling.


### React:

### Pros:

* Comprehensive Documentation: Like Flask, React also has extensive documentation and a much larger community, meaning find a solution for my problems would be much easier

* Inbuilt features: because react has become so popular in the web developement sphere it was been able to focus on important parts and add features like hooks

### Cons:

* Complexity: react is seen as a complex language for people who program with it, needing to learn from the ground up would slow down developement drastically

* Combining with backend: getting the two languages to work together can be done however it is tricky
