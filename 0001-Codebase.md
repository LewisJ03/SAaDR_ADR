# Back-end tech stack to be used for development

## Context and Problem Statement

What back end webframes will you be using and why will they be beneficial?

I will be using python and flask to communicate with the databases to effectively handle user and library data.

## Decision Drivers

* Readability as many python webframes allow for a programmer to make effective code but that is also not easy to follow.
* Refined code so that communcications through the backend from the frontend to the databases takes as little time as possible.

## Considered Options

* Flask
* Django
* Fast API

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Flask", because there is a large amount of documentation about the webframe, as well as the simplicity compared to other webframes which will allow for quicker development times.

### Consequences

* Good, because it allows for quick, straightforward learning and development.
* Bad, because other webframes such as django are better for implementing SQL and database handling.
* Good, because it has easier readability, allowing other developers to understand it easier.
* Bad, as it is less effective compared to other webframes in terms of scalability.


## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Flask:

### Pros:

* Simplicity and Documentation: Flask is known for its straightforward and minimalistic design, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to quickly learn and implement a back end. Its simplicity allows for a faster setup, which is beneficial for smaller projects or those with shorter timelines.

* Readability: Due to its minimalistic nature, Flask code is generally easier to read, which facilitates onboarding for new developers and supports a collaborative development environment.

### Cons:

* Scalability Limitations: Flask is not inherently designed with scalability in mind, which may make it less suitable for larger applications or those expecting significant growth in traffic.

* Less Built-in Database Support: While Flask can work with databases, it requires more manual setup compared to frameworks like Django, which comes with more built-in support for ORM and SQL database handling.


### Django:

### Pros:

* Comprehensive Documentation: Like Flask, Django also has extensive documentation and a large community, which can speed up development and troubleshooting.

* Scalability: With Django, applications can scale more effectively due to its structure and built-in support for handling large databases and high levels of traffic.

### Cons:

* Complexity: Django is a more extensive framework, which can make it harder to learn and implement, particularly for projects that require only a minimal back end.

* Readability and Maintenance: Django’s complex code structure may make it harder for new developers to read and follow the code, which can slow down development.
